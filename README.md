# Hooper App

Hooper app is a basketball app that display courts on the map and facilitates forums on each court for users to organize games. To have an idea of the competition, app also allows users to give each other feedbacks. 

This app was initially developed as the fourth section project at the Flatiron School, with the intention of working with the maps, and was refactored in 2022. Json Web Tokens were utilized for authentication and ActiveStorage to facilitate file upload for avatars.
